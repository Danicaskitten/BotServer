Here I am with some useful advices that I hope will help you to enjoy my fellowship

I can help you to find a specific movie or cinema and to make a reservation in zero time .

Here is the list of the commands that I understand:

1.	**Search Movie [title] or SearchMovie [title]**

	I will discover if the movie that you want is displayed in a cinema near your location.
	I will tell you all the cinemas that display the movie that you want and I will help you to make a reservation

2.	**SearchCinema [name] or Search Cinema [name]**

	I will discover what movies are displayed in the cinema that you want and I will help you to make a reservation for the movie that you choose.

3.	**All Projections or AllProjections**

	I will send you all movies that are available in the cinema now and I will help you to choose your cinema and to make a reservation.

Now I can also reply to direct request **without using a specific command**.
Example: "I wanna see Avengers" or "I need some help" and so on...

**Notes**

* All the parameters surrounded by [] are optional

* I am not case sensitive, so capital letters are not necessary
